Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial fleet, 
led by Darth Vader, dispatches Probe Droids across the galaxy to find Princess 
Leia's Rebel Alliance, with one probe locating the rebel base on the ice planet Hoth. 
A wampa captures Luke Skywalker before he can investigate the probe, but he escapes by 
using the Force qto retrieve his lightsaber and wound the beast. Before succumbing to 
hypothermia, the Force spirit of Luke's deceased mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi,
instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train as a Jedi Knight 
under the Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and insulates him against 
the weather inside his deceased tauntaun mount until they are rescued the 
next morning.
