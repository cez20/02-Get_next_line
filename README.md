This project aims to reproduce the behavior of the fgets() function in C which consists of reading the content of a file with a specific buffer size 

### Purpose 

Learn more extensively about the concepts of file descriptors, buffer and static variables. Also, read a file in its entirety while changing the buffer size and reading from different file descriptors simultaneously. 

To change the buffer size, simply modify it from inside the Makefile. 

### Usage

``make`` : compiles program allowing to read text from one file descriptor 

``make bonus`` : compiles program that allows to read text from different file descriptors. (Ex: switching from one file descriptor to another is possible.)
